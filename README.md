ASTROTUHNDER is the website for my new portfolio. I had a very simple portfolio in the past and didn't feature much of my work or exactly what I do there. ASTROTHUNDER is a full-blown PWA app based on React and uses Contentful for the content delivery.

The design of the app was the main focus. If you are a hip-hop fan like me, you may realise that the project's name is a song from Travis Scott's Astroworld album, and ASTROTHUNDER happens to be one of my favourite tracks off the tape. The main inspiration for the design came from the "When you hustle, always make it fancy" verse on the STOP TRYING TO BE GOD track, and that's why a lot of the design elements you see on the site are not something you would usually see around the web. I wanted the design of the site to stand out from every other portfolio you see on the internet. This was a tiny side project for me, so I worked on it over the months. And the end product is a design that's equally weird and unique.

Feel free to fork this project and put your own twist to it. It's an ordinary React app that you can install with `yarn install` so go ahead and play around with things :)
